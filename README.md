## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**ZethanSimmons/ZethanSimmons** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++
- I want to learn Zig
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Old English (sometimes called Anglo-Saxon), color theory, colorblindness, philosophy, classical grammar, keyboard ergonomics, evolution of bacterial antibiotic resistance in phages 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email me at axonfifty@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He, him, and his
- âš¡ Fun fact: According to opponent process theory, there are 5 unmixed perceptual color hues: red, green, blue, yellow, and white.
- Fun fact 2: Dopamine is involved in the anticipation, not the consumtion, of reward. Dopamine is also key to learning, enjoyment, and goal-oriented behavior. So then, in order to have effective learning, enjoyable living, and strong task completion, perhaps you need to have the feeling of anticipating reward in relation to that learning, that task, or activities in your daily life.
